# Chat

Your task is to implement chat based on requirements of [following task](https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/RS-Short-Track/wiki/6.-Chat), but you should React/Redux.
Please do not treat this as regular task it is more like 'test task' for your interview.
Apply all knowledge that you gathered during the course, use any technology you think you should, it fully ok unless you can't reason why you use it.

You will be able to chat with other students and trainers, so please be nice ☺️.

Your implementation of chat should be deployed and available anywhere by public link. (My recommend hosting is [heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)).
Please add this link to PR.

It will be mandatory for interiver to check your PR and discuss your task during the interview session.
