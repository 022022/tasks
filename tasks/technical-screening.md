# Technical screening 

### Purposes:
1) To form the list of the students at **RSSchool stage#2**.
2) To form the "Mentor-students" subgroups. Each mentor interviews more people than he plans to train (e.g +2). When all interviews are done mentor expells some students (e.g -2). Mentor can postpone exclusion for a couple of weeks if he/she needs to take more considered decision.
3) To test students' qualification.
4) To get experience of passing the interviews.
