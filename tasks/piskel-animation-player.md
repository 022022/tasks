This task is the continuation of the [CodeJam Pallete](./codejam-pallete.md)

## Mock ups / UI prototype
https://www.figma.com/proto/hieu0x13Znk8pzwej9oTrK/animation-player?node-id=1%3A2&scaling=min-zoom


#### `Frames`

- Ability to delete a frame
- Ability to duplicate a frame

#### `Preview`
- Ability to animate the created frames  
- Ability to change FPS rate from 1 to 24 per second
- Ability to run the animation in Full screen mode

### Functional requirements
- Please use `Frames` and `Preview` components of https://www.piskelapp.com/ as an ideal example of what should be done.
- Should work in Chrome

### Non-functional requirements
- Components source files should be stored in the folders with the component name.
- When you finalize one functionality you should commit you intermediate results. You can refactor and commit changes till deadline. For more details, please read - https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/docs/blob/master/ru/stage2-tasks-requirements.md
- You CAN use jQuery only to work with DOM API (no widget / jquery ui)
- You CANNOT use any framework like Angular / React / Vue
- You CANNOT use any lib
- You CAN use Material design or Bootstrap
- You CAN use preprocessors 
  
### How to deliver
Your work should be based on your implementation of [CodeJam Pallete](./codejam-pallete.md).
At the beginning of the work create a branch from `codejam-dom-pallete` called `animation-player`.
Then please follow the [general requirements from stage 2](https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/docs/blob/master/ru/stage2-tasks-requirements.md).
