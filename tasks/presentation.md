### Presentation
Your task is to prepare a presentation on a given topic (offered or approved by mentor). The whole list of appropriate topics could be found here - https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/lectures.

Requirements:
* 8 - 10 minutes for presentation
* Talk rehearsal within your subgroup is obligatory
* Speaker notes for each slide is obligatory
* Language - English.

**For Slides you have to use The HTML Presentation Framework  - [Reveal](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/)**.
**Usage of https://slides.com/ is forbidden**

### Passing the task
   1. Record your speech (I remind you that it has to be in English) on the phoneâ€™s camera. First of all, your face should be visible, but slides may not get on the record. Good example - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JezLAu4751Y&feature=youtu.be;
  2. Upload the resulting video to your YouTube account. You may set the *unlisted* property for your video, which means that only those who have the link will see it;
  3. Add a link to your slides to video description;
  4. Create a branch "presentation" at your private repository. Create markdown file "presentation.md" and fill it with: 
     - Link to your YouTube video;
     - Link to your Reveal presentation;
     - Link to the transcript of your presentation;
     - Your comments (optional);  

  Create PR, add your mentor to it.
